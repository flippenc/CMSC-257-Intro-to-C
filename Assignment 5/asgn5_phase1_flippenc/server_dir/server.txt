CMSC 257 Asgn 5 Phase 1 - Server Pseudocode

Obtain the port from the command line parameters and store it into a variable
If an invalid port is entered, print a message and exit with an error condition
The port should be between 50000 and 60000

Create a socket
Set socket options

Bind the socket

Listen for connections

Keep looping until something causes the server to stop, this allows for potentially infinitely many clients to connect
In phase 2, signal handling will be added and a signal will be used to close the program gracefully

Accept client connection
Fork and allow the child to handle the client session
The parent function will close down the client connection once the child is done

CHILD FUNCTION:

Read the filename from the client
Open the specified file with the flags needed to send it correctly

While there is data left to send from the file:
Read up to 50 bytes of the file into a buffer
Send the buffer to the client
If there is an error sending the file, print an error and close the client connection

When the whole file has been sent to the client, close the file

END OF CHILD FUNCTION

PARENT FUNCTION:

close the client socket

END OF PARENT FUNCTION
