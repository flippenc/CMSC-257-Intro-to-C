CMSC 257 Asgn 5  Phase 1 - Client Pseudocode

Obtain command line parameters and store them into variables
The parameters will be the port, IP, and filename
If the parameters are not in the correct format, print a message
and exit with an error condition
Port should be between 50000 and 60000
IP should be the IPv4 format
The filename should be <= 50 characters long

Create a socket
Set socket options

connect to the server
If the program can't connect, print a message and exit with an error condition

send a message to the server containing the filename
If sending the message fails, print a message and exit with an error condition

Open a file with the same name as the name sent to the server
Use the correct flags for opening the files so that it can be created and written to correctly

Use a loop to keep reading information from the server and writing the received data to the file
This program will receive the file 50 bytes at a time
If there is an error reading or writing, print a message and exit with an error condition

The client has received all of the data from the server at this point,
so the program is done for the client, time to close everything on the client side

close the file
The server will close the client socket
exit the client with a success condition
